				<h1 class="p-title">US Poverty Correlation to Obesity, Age, Income</h1>

				<p>Using a Data Driven Document (D3), I visualized the correlation of the percentage of people in each state who live in poverty to three factors: percentage of people that are obese, median age, and median state income. The dynamic proprty of the graph allows a user to select the value of the x-axis they want to compare with the poverty percent that is on the y-axis. Also, users can hover the mouse over a specific data point to see which state it is and the specific values for that position. Lets give it a go!</p>

				<h2 class="p-title">Takeaways</h2>
				<p >There are several interesting takeaways from this data. The youngest and oldest states, Utah and Maine, are on the lower end of the poverty scale. There is a positive correlation between Obesity and Poverty, with Washington DC being an exception. They have the second lowest Obesity rate amongst all 50 states but have 17.7% living in poverty. There is no suprise that there is a negative correlation between poverty and income; as median state income increases the percent of pople living in poverty decreases. Again Washington DC stands out, this time with a tied for second highest income and 17.7% poverty rate.</p>
